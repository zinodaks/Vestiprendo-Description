# Vestiprendo-Description
*Vestigo* is a latin word that means **track**. *Deprendo* is a latin word that means **detect**. Hence the name , ***Vestiprendo***. 

Vestiprendo is an IoT system that connects companies and individuals straight to their vehicles allowing them to *track* and *detect* real-time changes that occur on those vehicles. 

It allows users to see real-time tracking data from their vehicles such as location , speed , & fuel level. 
The system will inform users of any violation of a preset speed limit when exceeded. The user will also receive notifications when the fuel level decreases in an abnormal level that could indicate fuel theft. 
Several other sensors are installed on the vehicles that serve to inform the users about any alcohol or smoke violations that occur inside the vehicle's cabin. With an objective of stopping drivers from driving under the influence , or smoking certain drugs in the vehicle , the system will notify the user when the driver is drinking alcohol or smoking. 


## How is it built ?
- React for the website
- Flutter for the mobile application 
- Arduino on the vehicle
- Google Maps API for tracking
- Firebase and Google Cloud Functions for the backend

*The system is yet to be released but is already in the testing phase. Many more features that are not mentioned here are explained in details in the design document. The design document for the system architecture and the code of the system is part of a private repository. You can contact me if interested in seeing my work. I will provide a Google Drive link to videos that showcase the website & mobile application in function.*

**For companies interested to see my work for evaluation , access can given to the private repository upon request**
